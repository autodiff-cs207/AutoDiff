    "Derivatives are used to solve a large variety of modern-day problems. There are three general methods used to calculate derivatives:\n",
    "1. Symbolic differentiation \n",
    "2. Numerical differentiation\n",
    "3. Automatic differentiation \n",
    "\n",
    "Symbolic differentiation can be very useful, but there are some functions that do not have a symbolic derivative. Additionally, symbolic differentiation can be very costly, as it may recalculate the same expressions many times, or the expression for the derivative may grow exponentially. Sometimes we can avoid these issues by numerically differentiating our function. Often this means using finite differences. The method of finite differences calculates derivative at point $x$ by using the following definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(x) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} f(x) \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Finite differences can also be very effective in certain situations. However, as with symbolic differentiation, finite differences has its problems. The biggest issue is that to obtain the most accurate estimate of $f'(x)$, we would like to make $h$ as small as possible; in fact, we would like $h$ to be infinitely small. However, we cannot *actually* make $h$ zero, and thus we must compromise and choose some small-but-not-zero value for $h$, which brings us to our second problem: we cannot precisely represent all numbers. Our machines only have a certain level of precision. When we compute our derivatives numerically we introduce error by approximating values to their closest machine equivalent. To avoid these issues, we turn to our third approach: automatic differentiation. "

We use operator overloading to redefine elementary operations to suit our problem. To see why this is useful, let's examine how dual numbers behave under different mathematical operations:\n",

    "\n",
    "Division also follows rules for derivatives.\n",

In line with our philosophy to make anything which is differentiable, an instance of `DiffObj`, out `Mathops` class provides certain classmethods, whose job is to wrap an expression of the form $sin(some\\_diff\\_obj)$ into another `DiffObj`, which supports the `get_val` and `get_der` functions which are crucial to our implementation of the Chain Rule."

    "1.\tFuture AD package should support Vector variables. Vector variables can easily be implemented as a list of Variables, but such implementation may be inefficient. The challenge for us is to use a better structure to represent Vectors and algorithms to calculate derivatives with respect to Vectors, without too much Python structure overhead.\n",
    "2.\tFurther support on matrices. We are aiming to implement Backpropogation. We will explore how to incorporate matrix operations into our code.\n",
    "3.\tWe aim to support a more natural coding experience. For example, as of now, the only way to use a constant in a function is to make the constant an instance of the Constant class. We are cognizant of the fact that the Constnat class is not really providing much functionality. We will aim to allow users to directly use constant numbers in their mathetmatical expressions."
