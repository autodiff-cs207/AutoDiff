    "Derivatives are used to solve a large variety of modern-day problems. There are three general methods used to calculate derivatives:\n",
    "1. Symbolic differentiation \n",
    "2. Numerical differentiation\n",
    "3. Automatic differentiation \n",
    "\n",
    "Symbolic differentiation can be very useful, but there are some functions that do not have a symbolic derivative. Additionally, symbolic differentiation can be very costly, as it may recalculate the same expressions many times, or the expression for the derivative may grow exponentially. Sometimes we can avoid these issues by numerically differentiating our function. Often this means using finite differences. The method of finite differences calculates derivative at point $x$ by using the following definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(x) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} f(x) \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Finite differences can also be very effective in certain situations. However, as with symbolic differentiation, finite differences has its problems. The biggest issue is that to obtain the most accurate estimate of $f'(x)$, we would like to make $h$ as small as possible; in fact, we would like $h$ to be infinitely small. However, we cannot *actually* make $h$ zero, and thus we must compromise and choose some small-but-not-zero value for $h$, which brings us to our second problem: we cannot precisely represent all numbers. Our machines only have a certain level of precision. When we compute our derivatives numerically we introduce error by approximating values to their closest machine equivalent. To avoid these issues, we turn to our third approach: automatic differentiation. "

We use operator overloading to redefine elementary operations to suit our problem. To see why this is useful, let's examine how dual numbers behave under different mathematical operations:\n",

    "Multiplication: $(x+x'\\epsilon) \\times (y + y'\\epsilon) = xy + y(x')\\epsilon+ x(y')\\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our definition of $\\epsilon$ allows the multiplication of dual numbers to behave like the product rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Division: $\\frac{(x+x'\\epsilon)}{(y + y'\\epsilon)} = \\frac{(x+x'\\epsilon)(y - y'\\epsilon)}{(y + y'\\epsilon)(y - y'\\epsilon)} = \\frac{xy+xy'\\epsilon-yx'\\epsilon}{y^2} = \\frac{x}{y}+\\epsilon \\frac{xy'-yx'}{y^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Division also follows rules for derivatives.\n",

    "$f(x+x'\\epsilon) = f(x)+\\epsilon f'(x)x'$\n",

    "$g(f(x+x'\\epsilon)) = g(f(x)+\\epsilon f'(x)x') = g(f(x))+\\epsilon g'(f(x))f'(x)x'$\n",
